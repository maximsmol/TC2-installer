It was accidentally set to 1 in this release.**\r\n\r\n* Fixed thread delays/contention\r\n  * Greatly improves frame consistency, especially when there are many particles rendered\r\n  * Removed spin waits from thread mutexes, which were set too high for large amounts of threads, taking away time from actual work. Ideal wait times are job specific anyway, and job start times are not reliable. So, spinning will usually result in a lot of useless work.\r\n  * Increased global thread pool priority to above normal, to reduce delays in scheduling and finishing a job list. This is especially important for particles, which efficiently split the work up across many threads, but return too early for the blocking thread to efficiently end in most circumstances. Before, particle system rendering time was entirely up to the scheduler to finish, and it would more often than not respond to all jobs being done until 3 to 5ms later.\r\n* Reduce draw calls by increasing buffer sizes for index and vertex buffer, and uncapping vert/index counts\r\n* Optimized mouse calculations\r\n  * Mouse no longer locked to center of screen per frame, instead it is bounded within the window passively\r\n    * This was happening twice (now not at all) due to a bug in how VGUI updated the mouse\r\n    * This should also fix issues with the mouse leaving the window on multi monitor set ups\r\n  * Cached window offset so that a transformation from window to screen is not needed\r\n* Optimized thread distribution to better respect the main thread and better use hyper-threading/SMT threads\r\n  * There seems to have been a few bugs which biased threads towards the first few cores\r\n* Reduced the number of clears done to RTs and screen\r\n  * Shadows no longer clear twice every frame\r\n  * Additional buffers do not clear as a side effect to being added to the main view\r\n  * Got rid of many duplicate skybox related clears\r\n  * View now relies on clear at end of frame from VGUI, rather than clearing screen twice per frame\r\n  * Optimized some clears related to water reflection and refraction\r\n* Make beam count optimization default for

Many of these cases were just removed, as they had no business setting the engine seed. Other cases were solved by the next patch note.\r\n  * Some of these game systems would also rely on this seed to generate a sequence of random numbers. However, it is possible that the seed would be set by another system, thus changing the resulting sequence. This was fixed by adding scoped randomness to the system random number generator. This blocks any other interaction with the RNG system until the scope is over, and also restores the RNG state from before the scope was started.\r\n    * One notable system affected by this change was the weapon spread system. It would generate 4 floats to determine the horizontal and vertical spread. Also affected is random crit generation.\r\n   * Notable problematic systems were many places within the UI and animation systems affecting the main random number generator seed.\r\n  * **Note:** still need to investigate side effects of this, and if they are \"intended\" (coincidental or decided)\r\n  * **Note:** this still isn't _perfectly_ replicatable RNG, though it is very close. It is currently unknown what is causing the variance in patterns sometimes, though a possible cause is fast floating point math.\r\n* Demo player now uses the same RNG seed each play, resulting in fairly consistent demo playback\r\n* Enabled `tf_use_fixed_weaponspreads 1` by default\r\n* Used new scoped RNG to implement fixed spread for continuous fire weapons. (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2487)\r\n  * Starts at a fixed seed every \"perfect shot\" (1.25 seconds for single shot continuous weapons like the pistol, and 0.25 seconds for multi shot continuous weapons like the minigun), where TF2 shoots a bullet exactly at the crosshair, and advances the fixed seed every shot after (just like non fixed continuous fire).

This lets server operators enforce first person taunts for competitive integrity.

This is because the higher quality ones include a superset of the bones used in the lower quality ones\r\n* Fixed possible error in bone setup from prediction\r\n* Remove hack which forced recalculation of bones every frame\r\n* Skipped expensive check to opt out of the IK in bone calculation\r\n* Disabled threaded client shadow manager, because it is out of the dependencies for a bone, causing setup bones to be requested again in a frame when it can happen in order\r\n* Fixed one crashbot exploit\r\n* Disabled cloud settings by default so that the game does not conflict with live TF2\r\n* Queued decals are now disabled because they caused crashes in some maps\r\n* Fixed crash and output handler (@maximsmol)\r\n* Removed/fixed many warning messages (@maximsmol)\r\n* Added build instructions (@maximsmol)\r\n* Fixed many dev scripts (@maximsmol)\r\n* Optimized excessive memory allocations within static mesh draw pass\r\n* StatTraks are now only updated on your own viewmodel\r\n* Significantly optimized TF eye look ats\r\n* Optimized choreo scene think (from CS:GO)\r\n* Slightly optimized material precache, and disabled hack on macOS\r\n* Optimized flexed vertex computations with new Vector4DWeightMADSSE implementation in DirectX Math\r\n* Optimized world surface mesh index builder\r\n* Disabled async sound mixing by default, as it spends a lot of empty time. Will revisit in the future if we can find a better way to tie work to the mixer.\r\n* Updated various trace lengths to 8192 rather than being practically infinite:\r\n  * Server side voice response when looking at another player\r\n  * Inspect trace on other players\r\n  * Sniper rifle dot trace\r\n  * Ash particles\r\n  * Removed change which forced client side traces to be infinite rather than 8192\r\n* Cleaned up debugging/function overhead in shader logic\r\n* Fix wrap in index buffer code\r\n* Cleaned up dynamic mesh draw code to be less intensive and disruptive to the threaded renderer pipeline (would often force flushes and full rendering pipeline to be completed at random times). Fixing this introduced a known bug: viewmodels will not render instantly while player models are spawning in, will be fixed soon.\r\n* Ported over SlerpBonesSpeed from CS:GO for fast bone calculations\r\n* Enabled possible fast path in some simple meshes"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2/releases/29739335", "assets_url":

work!\r\n\r\n[**Installation instructions**](https://github.com/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2#install)\r\n\r\n* Improved `fps_max` to be much more accurate and not be off by a few frames on some CPUs\r\n* Optimized async texture loader to be event based rather than busy wait\r\n* Reduced texture streaming transition fade time from 5 seconds to 1 second\r\n* Optimized case insensitive string compares, which most notably improves command execution performance (critically for move commands, voice commands, etc)\r\n* Optimized shader system\r\n* Stripped DX8 and DX7 support\r\n* Dropped support for Windows XP\r\n  * Optimizes filesystem stat call\r\n* Enabled async model cache by default\r\n* Enabled frame pointer omission to disable \r\n* Disabled telemetry and ETW\r\n  * Fixed modules with telemetry disabled not being compatible with ones that do have telemetry enabled\r\n* Added threaded sound mixing\r\n* Adjusted default mixahead time from 0.1 to 0.0666667 seconds\r\n* Added support for `g_ragdoll_lvfadespeed` and `g_ragdoll_fadespeed` to TF ragdolls. You can set fade speed to 0 to skip the fading process.\r\n* Optimized `cl_ragdoll_force_fade 1`, which now instantly starts fading away with `cl_ragdoll_fade_time 0`\r\n* Cosmetics now use `cl_ragdoll_fade_time` for their fade delay, rather than a hard coded 15 seconds\r\n* Optimized sound playback by notifying the sound system to async load even when we are playing from cache. This reduces sound latency while reducing stutters related to the sound system.\r\n* A decal limit of 0 is now respected and dynamic decals will not spawn at all. This optimizes when decals are disabled, by not trying to spawn a decal.\r\n* Enabled threaded bone setup\r\n* Fixed shadows double rendering in the main scene\r\n* Fixed much of the scene being double rendered in the 3D skybox render\r\n* Fixed a possible crash in pixel shader lighting\r\n* Increased max `-threads` parameter from 4 to 12\r\n* Enabled development cvars\r\n* Optimized `exec` command\r\n* Optimized shadow vertex memory allocation overhead by using a contiguous block of memory as a pool that the shadow code sweeps and wraps around in instead of allocating vertex info on demand\r\n* Disabled VGUI traversing when element is not visible. This makes the main menu not render when in game, and the game HUD not render when in the main menu (when pressing ESC)\r\n* Fixed client interp getting desynced from server value due to incorrect bounded cvar implementation\r\n* Fixed client interp being checked every frame rather than only on change\r\n* Fixed anti-aliasing being disabled with `mat_antialias 1` causing some parts of the engine think it's not disabled and thus run some unnecessary code. On Linux, this used to force a full clear with AMD graphics.\r\n* Re-enabled code associated with various threading systems\r\n* Forced particle collision mode 3, which is the most optimized mode (and cached). This is done as a temporary measure while we find a way to fix particle data files to use a proper mode according to their needs. Please let me know of any glitchy particle collision. One known is flamethrower particle visuals.\r\n* Backported fix from Source 2 which prevents duplicated plane collision logic\r\n* Enabled queued decals\r\n* Enabled threaded client shadow manager\r\n* Enabled threaded client leaf system, which should reduce possible hitches or frame drops when changing rooms/turning corners\r\n* Enabled support for SSE2\r\n  * Fixed a crash that happened because of lightmap loop being vectorized\r\n* Optimized function calls by enabling frame pointer omission\r\n* Enabled whole program optimization through link time code generation\r\n* Optimized file system by enabling Retail mode\r\n* Fixed cheap water being disabled if reflections were enabled\r\n* Implemented SIMD instructions with DirectXMath which used to be Xbox 360 only (now ported to PC!), to accelerate many critical math/animation calls, including:\r\n  * Trig functions (sin, cos, atan2, etc)\r\n  * Quaternion functions (for animation rotations, and more)\r\n  * Slerp bones\r\n  * Calculate bone quaternion\r\n  * Vector add, subtract, muladd, msub, dot product\r\n  * Vector4DWeightMAD\r\n  * Enabled optimized visibility leaf bounding box algorithm (both rough box intersection test and visibility tests)\r\n  * Stripped complex vector conversion logic with DirectXMath\r\n* Added `r_skybox_lowend` to enable DX8 skyboxes on DX9\r\n* Added `-particle_fallback` launch option to control particle quality. 2 uses DX8 particles, 1 uses lowend DX9 particles, 0 uses default.\r\n* Enabled many mastercomfig optimizations by default\r\n* Enabled fast vertex texture support, which optimizes rendering of many different shaders. Only works on dxlevel 100.\r\n* Added prediction system fix to prioritize server data\r\n* Added networking and spy fixes to dispenser and teleport\r\n* Added `tf_skip_halloween_bomb_hat_translucency`, which enables the DX8 behavior of snapping to invisible halloween bomb hats whenever spy is in the middle of cloaking\r\n* Disabled D3D multithreaded mode, as it adds overhead and does not add meaningful safety to the multithreaded renderer\r\n* Fixed crashes associated with hardware morphing when fast vertex textures are enabled and the rendered is queued. This does not add morphing support.\r\n* Enabled team menu in Mannpower\r\n* Added `tf_use_match_hud`, which enables the match HUD in all servers. Large version of the match HUD is used if there are more than 12 players on either team. Work in progress. This is reimplementing a Jungle Inferno feature which is not present in the leak.\r\n* Added `cl_hud_playerclass_playermodel_lod`, which controls the LOD of the player class model.\r\n* Removed server console spam when the player has no Steam ID\r\n* Added compatibility with the latest Windows 10 SDK and MSVC 2019\r\n* Added some minor shadow fixes from CS:GO"}]
